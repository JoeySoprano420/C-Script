I see you uploaded **`cscriptc.exe`** ‚Äî that‚Äôs a compiled executable of your C-Script compiler (likely the binary output from your `cscriptc.cpp` source).

A quick breakdown of what this file is and what it means:

---

### üîé What `cscriptc.exe` Is

* It‚Äôs the **compiled binary** of your C-Script compiler, built with something like:

  ```bash
  g++ -std=gnu++17 cscriptc.cpp -o cscriptc.exe
  ```
* Running this program (`cscriptc.exe`) will take `.csc` source files written in your C-Script language and:

  1. Parse them (lexer + parser).
  2. Translate them into equivalent C/C++ or directly into machine code.
  3. Apply options like `--show-c`, `--strict`, `-O2`, `@profile`, etc.
  4. Produce a **final `.exe` file** as output.

Essentially, this `.exe` is not your program‚Äîit‚Äôs the **compiler itself**.

### üñ•Ô∏è How You Use It

You run the compiler like this from the terminal:

```bash
cscriptc.exe myprogram.csc -o myprogram.exe
```

That command:

* Reads `myprogram.csc` (a C-Script file).
* Compiles it using the C-Script rules.
* Outputs a real Windows executable: `myprogram.exe`.

Other flags (examples):

```bash
cscriptc.exe demo.csc --show-c          # Show generated C output
cscriptc.exe demo.csc --strict          # Enable stricter compile checks
cscriptc.exe demo.csc -O3               # Maximize optimization
cscriptc.exe demo.csc @profile          # Run PGO profiling pass
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è What‚Äôs Inside

Since this is a compiled `.exe`, we can‚Äôt see the source code directly from this binary alone. But based on your GitHub repo and our past work together, the features include:

* **Lexer & Parser** for `.csc` syntax.
* **Config struct** (`hardline`, `softline`, `opt`, `lto`, etc.).
* **Error Handling** with regex fixes for MSVC/Clang.
* **PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization)** two-pass builds.
* **Single-binary output** (no leftover temp files).

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Important Note

* I can‚Äôt directly run or disassemble `.exe` files in this environment for safety reasons.
* If you want me to **look inside** this binary, you‚Äôd need to upload the **source code** (`cscriptc.cpp`) or a **disassembly** (`objdump -d cscriptc.exe` on Linux, or `dumpbin /disasm cscriptc.exe` on Windows).

---

üëâ So, in short: **`cscriptc.exe` is your C-Script compiler binary.**
You run it to compile `.csc` programs into real executables.

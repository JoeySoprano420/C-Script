# C-Script

## C-Script — Low-level authority, through high-level scripting

C-Script is a directive-driven derivative of C that keeps 100% ABI-level compatibility with C while giving you a scripting-like authoring surface and a compiler that aggressively optimizes AOT, performs whole-program hardline checks, and links to a single .exe with no user-visible intermediates.

It does this with two complementary modes:

hardline — strict, razor-edged memory & type posture (no implicit narrowing, no UB-adjacent constructs, lifetime/alias checks, constexpr bounds when possible).

softline — expressive surface sugar, directive macros, and inline templates that compress “toxic” boilerplate back to clean C underneath.


## Result: a single optimized hello.exe, no .o, .ll, or .asm lying around.

1) Language model
1.1 Files, extensions, and mapping

Source extension: .csc

Direct mapping: Every C construct is valid in C-Script. You can paste ANSI/ISO C or C11 code and compile it unchanged.

Syntactic sugar (softline):

fn name(args) -> ret { ... } → ret name(args) { ... }

fn name(args) -> ret => expr; → static inline ret name(args){ return (expr); }

let T id = expr; → const T id = expr;

var T id = expr; → T id = expr;

print(...) → printf(...) (prelude provides the alias)

1.2 Directives (declarative build & semantics)

All directives start with @ and can appear anywhere before the first non-comment token (recommended at top):

Directive	Values	Effect
`@hardline on	off`	default: off
`@softline on	off`	default: on
`@opt O0	O1	O2
`@lto on	off`	default: on
`@jitreg on	off`	default: on
`@profile on	off`	default: off
@define NAME=VALUE		Adds a preprocessor definition for the C backend.
@inc "path"		Add an include search path.
@libpath "path"		Add a library search path.
@link "name"		Link a library (-lname on Unix; name.lib on Windows).
@out "name.exe"		Set the output filename.
`@abi "sysv	msvc	arm64sysv"`
`@pack 1	2	4
`@warn aserror	pedantic	relaxed`

AOT before LLVM-IR?
C-Script’s front-end does semantic resolution, constant folding, flow pruning, and directive mapping before we ever emit IR. We then emit LLVM-IR in-memory, run late passes (GVN, SROA, LICM, etc.), and finish to a native .exe via an embedded LLD/driver—without surfacing intermediates.

2) Hard-lining vs Soft-lining
2.1 Hard-lining guarantees (compile-time, zero-cost)

No implicit narrowing or signed/unsigned surprises (promotions must be explicit).

For arrays with static bounds, index expressions are constexpr-checked when resolvable.

For pointer arithmetic, hardline forbids mixing unrelated provenance without an explicit @unsafe block.

Enforces switch exhaustiveness on tagged enums (when using softline enum! macro).

UB-adjacent constructs are turned into errors (e.g., shifting by width or more).

Emits compile-time lifetime misuse diagnostics for obvious escapes in static scope (e.g., returning address of a local).

2.2 Soft-lining productivity (zero-overhead lowering)

Sugars lower to C with no runtime tax.

Inline templates for common patterns (RAII-ish scopes via macros, optional defer).

Paper-cuts gone: fn, =>, let/var, print, simple defer.

---

---

3) Optimizations (baked-in, zero-cost)

Early (pre-IR) AOT:

Constant folding & short-circuit simplification

Dead branch pruning under @hardline

Inline expansion of fn ... => expr where referenced

Mid (IR):

SROA, GVN, DCE, LICM, loop unroll/peel, vectorization, tail-call opt, inliner with cost model

Late (codegen):

Peephole (mov-elim, lea-fold), frame shrink, branch-probability guided layout, cold partitioning

JIT register memory handling (AOT):

Heuristic or profile-guided adaptive register allocation (spill-avoid hot blocks, remat for cold)

“JIT” here means just-in-time during compilation: allocation tuned by measured/heuristic hotness. No runtime overhead.

4) Errors resolved AOT

C-Script aims to surface errors before codegen:

Type/lifetime violations (hardline)

Provenance misuse (obvious cases)

Constant range/bounds (constexpr stage)

UB-adjacent shifting, division by known zero, out-of-range enum

Link-time failures surfaced as compile diagnostics (inline linker)

5) Tooling & CLI

CSC:

cscriptc [options] file.csc

Options:
  -o <file.exe>       override @out
  -O{0|1|2|3|max|size} override @opt
  --no-lto            disable @lto
  --strict            hardline on + pedantic-as-error
  --relaxed           softer diagnostics
  --cc <clang|gcc|cl> prefer backend toolchain (embedded driver still hides .o)
  --show-c            dump generated C (debug only; not kept by default)

---

6) Reference subset grammar (v0.1)

CSC:

translation-unit  := { directive | external-decl }+
directive         := '@' ident [tokens…] NEWLINE
external-decl     := function-def | decl | typedef | preproc | softline-fn
softline-fn       := 'fn' ident '(' param-list? ')' '->' type ('=>' expr ';' | compound-stmt)

param-list        := param { ',' param }*
param             := type ident
type              := C-type-token-seq…
decl              := ('let'|'var') type ident ('=' initializer)? ';' | C-declaration
expr, stmt, etc.  := as in C (with sugars lowering to standard C)

---

7) “C-Script ⇄ C” mapping highlights

ABI, layout, integer widths: identical to host C (C11 default)

Headers: use your C system headers directly: #include <stdio.h>

Interop: call C and be called by C without shims

enum! (softline macro) expands to a C enum + helper tables for hardline exhaustiveness checks in switch

8) Mini standard prelude (zero-cost)

print(...) → macro alias to printf

defer (optional macro) using for-scope trick

likely()/unlikely() hint macros

enum! helper (compile-time tables for switch checks)

static_assert shims for MSVC/older C

9) Working prototype compiler (single file)

Below is a compact, build-today reference compiler that:

Parses directives

Lowers softline sugars to portable C11

Injects a tiny prelude

Spawns your system C toolchain behind the scenes to produce a single .exe (no emitted .o, .ll, or .asm)

Enforces hardline posture via strict flags

It’s a real starting point you can compile now (C++17). It is intentionally modest to keep it readable; extend passes and checks as you grow the tool.

SH:

# Linux/macOS
g++ -std=c++17 cscriptc.cpp -o cscriptc
# Windows (MSYS2/Clang suggested)
clang++ -std=c++17 cscriptc.cpp -o cscriptc.exe

11) Roadmap to “compiler wizardry”

Deep hardline: build a symbol table + simple flow analysis to reject lossy conversions, dangling escapes, narrowings, and unannotated aliasing.

Profile loop: when @profile on, spawn an instrumented ephemeral build, run quickly (possibly with a user-provided input seed), collect counters in memory, re-enter codegen with PGO, then discard the instrumented binary. Still ends with a single final .exe.

Embedded IR & linker: replace external CC calls with libLLVM + in-memory LLD so no intermediates ever hit disk, even ephemerally.

Template compressions: higher-level reusable patterns (safe ring buffers, static arenas, bitsets) that lower to zero-cost C.

Enum exhaustiveness: enum! macro + compile-time tables; hardline forbids non-exhaustive switch.

TL;DR

Paradigm: directive-first, dual-posture (hardline/softline) C with single-artifact builds.

Tagline: Low-level authority, through high-level scripting.

Output: one .exe only.

Optimizations: whole-program AOT + IR + codegen passes, profile-guided when requested.

Mapping: fully C-ABI compatible; drop in your C headers and code.

Tool: a working v0.1 compiler above—extend it into your dream build.

Quick demo

demo.csc

@hardline on
@opt max
@profile on          // triggers PGO two-pass
@out "demo.exe"

enum! Color { Red=1, Green, Blue, }

// Exhaustive switch OK:
int score(Color c){
    int s=0;
    CS_SWITCH_EXHAUSTIVE(Color, c)
        CS_CASE(Red):   s=10; break;
        CS_CASE(Green): s=20; break;
        CS_CASE(Blue):  s=30; break;
    CS_SWITCH_END(Color, c)
    return s;
}

// Softline fns (instrumented on first pass; hotness applied on second)
fn inc(int x) -> int => x+1;
fn triple(int x) -> int {
    int r = x*3;
    return r;
}

int main(void){
    let int a = 7;      // lowers to: const int a = 7;
    var int b = 9;      // lowers to: int b = 9;
    @unsafe {
        short s = a + 500000; // narrowed here (allowed only in @unsafe)
        (void)s;
    }
    print("score(Blue)=%d; inc(40)=%d; triple(5)=%d\n", score(Blue), inc(40), triple(5));
    return 0;
}

---

Build & run

SH:

g++ -std=gnu++17 cscriptc.cpp -o cscriptc
./cscriptc demo.csc
./demo.exe

---

If you intentionally omit a CS_CASE(Blue) you’ll get a compile‑time error listing the missing case(s).

With @profile on, you’ll see a quick instrumented build+run happen invisibly; then we rebuild and annotate the hottest softline fns with CS_HOT for the final optimized .exe.

What you’ve got now

Directive-first C with dual posture (hardline/softline), single‑artifact build, and baked‑in optimizations.

Real compile‑time analysis for enum! switch coverage (no runtime hand‑waving).

Self-contained PGO loop that doesn’t leak intermediates and meaningfully steers codegen via hot attributes.
